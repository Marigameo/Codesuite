# Codesuite
Code made easy and fun

This is a part of my another application Thiran WebKit - A web app that facilitates students alumni relationships,register projects,get guidance,mentorship,funds and track events happening at the college.

Codesuite helps students in colleges to learn,practice and compete all at a go.It's an all in one platform to exel the art of coding.

Note : You may not run these files seperately since it will not have the server code file.I've made this as a part of another web app.Anyway it is worth to function as separate project,so I am giving the inteface files here separately.

Any way as collection you could get at Thiran Webskit repo.
